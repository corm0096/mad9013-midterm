Other buttons will not work at the time, and is a function of the assignment itself.  _Show First_ will become _Show Next_ and clicks on this button will scroll through the available data.

### Explanation:
Data is loaded from a json file, parsed and the relevant data displayed on screen.  The javascript also maintains a simple array of data previously-viewed to display as smaller, thumbnail images.
